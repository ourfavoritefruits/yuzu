yuzu is an experimental open-source emulator for the Nintendo Switch from the creators of [Citra](https://citra-emu.org/).

It is written in C++ with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for Windows and Linux. The emulator is capable of running several commercial games.

yuzu only emulates a subset of Switch hardware and therefore most commercial games **do not** run at full speed or are not fully functional.

Do you want to check which games are compatible and which ones are not? Please visit our [Compatibility page](https://yuzu-emu.org/game/)!

yuzu is licensed under the GPLv2 (or any later version). Refer to the license.txt file included.

### Development

Most of the development happens on GitHub. It's also where [our central repository](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu) is hosted.

If you want to contribute please take a look at the [Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/wiki/Contributing) and [Developer Information](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu/wiki/Developer-Information). You should also contact any of the developers on Discord in order to know about the current state of the emulator.

If you want to contribute to the user interface translation, please check out the [yuzu project on transifex](https://www.transifex.com/yuzu-emulator/yuzu). We centralize translation work there, and periodically upstream translations.
