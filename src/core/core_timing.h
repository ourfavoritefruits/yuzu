/**
 * This is a system to schedule events into the emulated machine's future. Time is measured

 * To schedule an event, you first have to register its type. This is where you pass in the
 * callback. You then schedule events using the type id you get back.
 *
 * The int cyclesLate that the callbacks get is how many cycles late it was.
 * So to schedule a new event on a regular basis:
 * inside callback:
 *   ScheduleEvent(periodInCycles - cyclesLate, callback, "whatever")
